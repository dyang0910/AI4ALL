# AI4ALL Machine Learning Project: Early Stroke Detection and Prevention

## Overview 

- Background: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death, accounting for 11.6% of deaths worldwide. Earlier prediction of stroke and be greatly helpful in preventing fatal outcomes and can encourage timely intervention to save many lives.
- Research Question: Can an ML model accurately predict the chance of stroke based on patient demographics and health symptoms?

## Goal
- In our project, we want to train several supervised machine-learning classification models to predict the likelihood of stroke based on the analysis of patients’ lifestyles, health index, and family history of stroke.
- We also want to use confusion matrices and accuracy scores to evaluate and analyze our models’ performance. 
- Ultimately, this project aims to predict a person’s risk of having a stroke using provided information so that more preventative measures can be taken in the future.
